tiered data storage with cold archive in azure blob storage.

Split your data into hot (recent) and cold (archived) storage:
Hot Tier (Cosmos DB): Retain only the last 3 months of billing records.
Cold Tier (Azure Blob Storage): Archive older records to Azure Blob in a cost-effective format like JSON or Parquet.
Access Layer (Proxy Logic via Azure Functions): Intercept read requests; if data is not found in Cosmos DB, fetch from blob storage.

1.Introduce an Archival Job (Azure Function + Timer Trigger)
Goal: Move records older than 3 months from Cosmos DB to Blob storage.
      Timer-triggered Azure Function (runs daily/weekly).
      Queries Cosmos DB for records older than 3 months.
      Exports data as JSON or Parquet files.
      Uploads to Azure Blob Storage (Cool or Archive Tier for lowest cost).
      Deletes archived records from Cosmos DB after successful storage.
      Use Azure Data Factory instead of Function if data size is very large.

2. Modify Read Logic with a Dual-Source Lookup
Goal: Serve records from Blob when missing in Cosmos DB.
      Wrap your current read logic in a middleware Azure Function or microservice.
      First, query Cosmos DB.
If not found, then:
       Construct blob path using a known key format (e.g., billingRecordId/year/month).
       Read the JSON/Parquet blob from Azure Blob Storage.
       Return result as if from Cosmos DB (same API schema).
       Response latency remains within a few seconds due to Blob read speed.

3.Optional: Cache Archived Records
  Use Azure Redis Cache to cache frequently accessed archived records temporarily.
  Avoid repeated Blob Storage lookups for the same old records.

4. Storage Structure in Blob
   Organize blobs for efficient lookup and future scalability:
   Use Azure Data Lake Gen2 hierarchical namespace for better performance if needed.

5. Monitoring & Fail-Safes
   Log archival success/failure in Azure Monitor.
   Alert on archival or fetch failures.
   Use ETags or record status flags to prevent double-deletion.

  
Requirement                              How Itâ€™s Fulfilled

Simplicity:                              Azure Function + Blob + Cosmos DB: all serverless, managed services.

No Data Loss:                            Archival job ensures success before deletion.

No Downtime:                             Gradual migration. New read logic seamlessly serves from both sources.

No API Contract Change:                  Read/write endpoints stay the same. Read proxy abstracts dual-source logic.

Cost Optimization:                       Cosmos DB size and RUs reduced. Blob storage (Cool/Archive) is 10x cheaper.


Optional Enhancements:

Compress JSON files to reduce Blob storage size.
Use Event Grid to trigger real-time sync if required.
Add metadata indexing (e.g., Azure Table Storage) for faster blob lookup if scale grows.
